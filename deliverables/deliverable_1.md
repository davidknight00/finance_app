### Interview 3:

**Summary:** An app displaying stock information should be simple and not too cluttered. It should display
information such as a stock's trading volume, market cap, average trading volume, and beta. Honesty and
transparency is the most important thing when creating something that will affect the user's financial 
well being. Users shouldn't see what other people are buying because then they will be buying without a
fundamental basis, rather hype/heat will be influencing their purchases and that could result in artificial
share prices.

  ## Interview 9:

  **Summary**: This tool would be very useful to see what the community is investing in rather than the hedge funds or large sharks. The best apps for these types of situations are the ones that will fill your oder, capture your portfolio, show your returns, the purpose of the funds, etc. If this can be accomplished with this app, then it would be very useful to even experienced stock users.

  **Key Insights**
  - Transparancy is the most important thing

  - Visually Pleasing

**Representative Quotes**
- Talking about transparancy: "Very important, financial literacy is tough to come by as information is
convoluted. A lot of impressionable young people will see a ton of get rich quick schemes like how some
guru turned 1,000 dollars into 1,000,000 on the beaches of fiji. And now they want to share this
information with you because they are very kind. The reality is, if they had a trading staretgy of merit
they’d leverage that 1 million and turn it into 100 million then 1 billion etc. If one wants to become
financially literate, id recommend reading books rather than checking the internet."

- "To be honest, I don’t really care what hedge funds or large sharks are investing
in, maybe they can point to bubble before it pops, or they can keep a stock at bay through the lending
market."

- "I don’t invest in any individual equities but rather ETFs with certain
profiles to accomplish different goals. I.e VOO is looking for large cap Growth, vs VGI give me total stock
domestic."

- Community is important
- Visuality of it is needed

**Assesment**
- Must be visually appealing and easy to use
- Must be based around community rather than huge businesses
- Must have news about every stock involved
