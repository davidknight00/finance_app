## Question 3
Interview (number):

Summary: An app displaying stock information should be simple and not too cluttered. It should display
information such as a stock's trading volume, market cap, average trading volume, and beta. Honesty and
transparency is the most important thing when creating something that will affect the user's financial 
well being. Users shouldn't see what other people are buying because then they will be buying without a
fundamental basis, rather hype/heat will be influencing their purchases and that could result in artificial
share prices.
