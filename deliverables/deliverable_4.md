## 1. Introduction
StockInfinity aims to provide transparent _stock_ information to users through multiple platforms to deliver a seamless experience and an exceptional level of accessibility. It is difficult to find a financial application that is not littered with unnecessary information. Many of the current _stock_ application powerhouses have had incidents in which they were exposed for ingenuine practices which have large impacts on an investor’s financial well being. For those who need honest and uncluttered information about their **favorite** _stocks_, Stock Infinity can bridge the gap that larger firms and companies have been incapable of providing. Our product offers a friendly interface that allows you to see the information that you need without the extra fluff. You can be confident that our product will deliver the information you need for your financial future without fail. A simple, honest, and comprehensive application that allows both novice and expert investors to view information on their preferred _stocks_ without having to sift through unnecessary information or worry about conflicting interests of shareholders affecting their access to information.

## 8. Readme File
**ToDo David**


## 9. Look & feel
During our interviews we found that it’s very common for stock related apps to bombard users  with information. We also deemed that our consumer segments mainly consisted of beginner to intermediate investors so we want to be able to stick to an incomplex look and feel. Overall we want StockInfinity to have a clean and simple UI. By implementing a simple design this will make the app more intuitive for users.

## 10. Lessons learned
**ToDo Finish**<br />
Overall, we didn't realize how intensive it would be to make so many pulls just to make one graph, let alone multiple. This, along with making a non-static page proved to be unforeseen problems that largely stunted the beginning phase of this project.
